HOTMAIL HACKING INFO.


I_1_I  - Brute force hacking
a. Use telnet to connect to port 110 (Hotmail´s pop-server)
b. Type USER and then the victim´s username
c. Type PASS and then the guess a password
d. Repeat that until U have found the correct password. 
!. This is called brute force hacking and requires patience. 
It´s better than trying to guess the victims password on 
hotmail homepage only because it´s faster. 
____
I_2_I  - The Best way 
a. Get the username of the victim (It usually stands in the adress-field
)
b. Then type " www.hotmail.com/cgi-bin/start/victimsusername "
c. U´re in! 
!. This hack only work if U are on the same network or computer as the 
victim and if he don´t log out. 
____
I_3_I  - The old way 
a. Go to http://www.hotmail/proxy.html
b. Now type the victims username. (press login)
c. Look at the source code.
d. On the fifth row U should find "action=someadress"
e. Copy that adress and paste it into the adress-field
f. You are in... 
!. As you can see it´s a long procedure and the victim have 
plenty of time to log out. 
____
I_4_I  - Another... 
a. Go to hotmail´s homepage
b. Copy the source code.
c. Make a new html file with the same code but change method=post to
method=enter
d. "view" the page
e. Change the adress to www.hotmail.com/ (don´t press enter!)
f. Make the victim type in his username and password
g. Look in the adress-field. There you´ll see ...&password:something... 
!. This is the way I use, because it lets you know the password. 
(If he exits the browser U can see the password in the History folder!)

READ!
Hotmail´s sysops have changed the "system" so that the victim may log
out even
if U are inside his/her account. So don´t waste U´r time!

So you want to get some hotmail passwords?  
This is pretty easy to do once you have got the hang of it.  
If you are a beginner, I wouldn't make this your first attempt at 
hacking.  When you need to do is use a port surfer and surf over to 
port 80.  While there, you have to try and mail the user that you 
want the password from.  It is best to mail them using the words 
"We" and "Here at Hotmail..."  Most suckers fall for this and end 
up giving out their password.  There is another way to also, you can 
get an anon mailer, and forge the addres as staff@hotmail.com.  But 
you have to change the reply address to go to a different addres 
like user@host.com.  The person that you are trying to get the pass 
from MUST respond to that letter for the mail to be forwarded to you. 
Have text like "Please reply to this letter with the subject "PASSWORD"
and underneith please include your user name and password.  
If you have trouble Loging in withing the next few days, this is 
only because we are updating our mail servers but no need to worry, 
your mail will still be there.  Even though the server may be down 
for an hour.  From the staff at Hotmail, Thank You."
